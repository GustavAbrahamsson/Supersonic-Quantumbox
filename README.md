# Supersonic-Quantumbox

Multi-use digital guitar pedal

## Features
This pedal is an experiment in digital sound processing, powered by an ESP32-S2 running arduino. Designed to be ultra-flexible, it has a wide array of controls and indicators including knobs, lights, a screen, true bypass switch and easily available expansions. The high performance analog components from texas instruments handle 24bit data at 48KHz. 

## Todo
This project is still WIP, alot of things can be improved to make the pedal as easy and fun as possible.

- [x] Menu system for managing multiple effects at the same time
- [x] Nice looking and sturdy enclosure
- [ ] Add lots different of effects
- [ ] Expansion port for expression pedals, switches and more
- [ ] PCB revision with ESP32-S3, better power supply filtering, footprint fixes
- [ ] Wi-Fi configuration?

Apart from this the pedal is designed to be an exploration platform for different DSP techniques and algorithms, so new effects will hopefully be added continously.
